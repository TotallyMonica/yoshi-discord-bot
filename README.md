This is, quite literally, the discord bot used in [my community discord server](https://discord.gg/PktAw7N) (Invites currently closed due to poor maintenance of it)

## Requirements

pip install discord.py
./main.py
# At this point, edit the file secrets.json that was generated with the appropriate tokens
